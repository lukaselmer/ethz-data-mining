----------------- Visual Test for your Classifier --------------------

This test is intended to give you a feeling of how the accuracy of
your predictions reflects visually. It uses the first 150 instances of
the training dataset.

Steps:

1. Output the predictions for the first 150 instances from the
training set predictions to prediction.txt. Each line should contain
the predicted class (-1 or 1).

2. Run visual_test.py which will generate an html page that contains
the images. The images are categorized as correctly classified or
missclassified for each class.

3. Open results.html and visually check the accuracy of your
classification.
